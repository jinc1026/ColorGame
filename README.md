# ColorGame

ColorGame was one of the core projects of WebDevBootcamp. 

The objective of the game is to correctly guess the color based on the given RGB value.
The focus of this project was javascript, DOM manipulation and jQuery. The page needs contact reaction based on
user input i.e. pading out incorrectly guessed color, updating header background color, updating restart button and etc.
